        <p id="my_hobbies">My hobbies are as I mentioned above, Playing <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/" class="Minecraft" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>, studying, Coding and even making stuff in <a href="https://www.blender.org/" class="Blender" target="_blank">Blender</a>(A software used for 3d development)! I make structures in <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/" class="Minecraft" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>, study new things, code new apps and programs and expect them to work and even if they don't I try to fix them using web, I even try to make some cool renders of <a href="https://www.lamborghini.com/en-en" class="Lambo" target="_blank">lamborghini</a> and my <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/" class="Minecraft" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> world in <a href="https://www.blender.org/" class="Blender" target="_blank">Blender</a> and practice to enhance my skills</p>
        <p id="Minecraft">I love <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/" class="Minecraft" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> because it is the only game that allows me to do anythign I want to do and there is no one to stop me! I have played many games throught my life and I hae seen that they have a specific task or mission to complete, eg: <b class="GTA">GTA</b> games, I have also played many racing games but they too were pretty boring because there is just one objective: to win, which is pretty obvious and leaves us with really less freedom of choice. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/" class="Minecraft" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> allows to play anything we want, we can race, fight, do missions in some servers, PVP with other players, play with friends, and this game also allows us the complete freedom to do whatever modifications we want to make in out game! The following picture is an example of what I have created in my beloved <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/" class="Minecraft" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>

        <p id="world_house">That white house was made by <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JUNS_MAB" class="yt" target="_blank">JUNS MAB Architectural Tutorials Channel</a></u> which is a good channel if you want to build structures and beautiful houses like that one!</p>
        <p id="continue_minecraft">Well, It is not as if I coppy everything from web or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" class="yt" target="_blank">youtube</a> and paste the exact replica in my worlds, I have made my own modifications to that house, also made my own structures throughout the world which are not included on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" class="yt" target="_blank">youtube</a>! That is <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/" class="Minecraft" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>! This is why I love it! </p>
        <p id="Blender">I also love <a href="https://www.blender.org/" class="Blender" target="_blank">Blender</a>. I keep on creating cool renders of objects I create or I find on webs such as a <a href="https://www.lamborghini.com/en-en" class="Lambo" target="_blank">lamborghini</a> model I ound on <a href="https://sketchfab.com/" id="sf" target="_blank">sketchfab</a>! I watch many tutorials on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" class="yt" target="_blank">youtube</a> and otehr websites on google. I don't waste much time behind this hobby but I think it is worth giving it some 10 minutes a day to keep the practice.</p>
